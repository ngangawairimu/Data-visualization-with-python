##  Project Overview 

This project aims to analyze the Coursera Course Dataset, applying data visualization and exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques learned in this and previous sprints. The dataset contains information on Coursera courses, including attributes such as course name, provider, ratings, price, and more. By performing EDA, we aim to extract actionable insights and identify patterns within the dataset.
## Insights
Course Ratings

- The majority of courses have high ratings, with an average of 4.68. The ratings are concentrated between 4.6 and 4.8, suggesting overall positive feedback from learners.
Course Enrollment

- Courses with the "Mixed" difficulty level have the highest average enrollment (97,768 students), followed by Beginner courses (79,057 students). This indicates that courses catering to a broader range of difficulty levels attract more learners.
The top 10 most-enrolled courses have enrollments ranging from 90,000 to 320,000 students, showing significant interest in certain topics.
Certificate Types

- Courses categorized under "COURSE" have the highest average rating (4.71) compared to other certificate types like "SPECIALIZATION" (4.62) and "PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATE" (4.70).
Specialization courses may benefit from improvements in content or structure to match the ratings of other certificate types.
Correlation Between Ratings and Enrollments

## Recommendations
Focus on Mixed-Level Courses

- Develop more "Mixed" difficulty courses, as these attract the most students. Consider creating courses that bridge foundational concepts with advanced applications.
Improve Specialization Courses

- Review and enhance the content of "Specialization" courses, focusing on learner feedback to improve ratings. Introduce practical projects or industry collaborations to make these courses more appealing.
Optimize Marketing for Beginner Courses

- Leverage marketing campaigns to promote Beginner-level courses, as they attract substantial enrollment. Highlight their accessibility and practical value for first-time learners.
